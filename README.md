Never give up 
see the beautiful in things 
Empower others and enjoy the magic 

I am tall but not so tall.
I am big but not so big.
I am smart but, but no but.

I am good but also bad. 
I am the one who sometimes makes you pretty mad. 
But never forget I can make you smile.

Such profound words
Difficult to be at level 
But indeed smart, with no but

Don't ask what your country can do for you.
Don't ask what others can do for you.
But instead, ask what can you do for your country and others.

....can you see my text now...

I think everyone have to learn new things day by day.
Afterwards people get confidence on what they learn and apply on real life.
They will be statisfied when they will work on it.
